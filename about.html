		<p>	My passion for technology has been with me from the beggining of my brains consinanace, I remember being 5 in El salvador and my mom giving me a atari type video game machine with all sorts of games
		built into it, at the time I couldnt stop playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.">Super Mario Bros</a> which was the old game that kids in the 80's played hours upon hours
		but for me even in El salvador its what kept me out of boredom of such a vile and destructive place San salvador is. Aside from that gaming system the only other things I can remeber from El salvador are 
		either gruesome or just superficial and not important in depicting my early childhood. As many who know me personally from school, I tend to have an attitude towards <b>authority figures</b> and this is not
		the way is was born. </p>
		<br></br>

		</div>
		<h2 class="section-title" style="padding-left: 37%;padding-right: 37%;"><span class="section-title">Life in El Salvador</span></h2>
		<p>While there were things that made me happy in El salvador like the taste of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pupusa"><em>pupusa</em></a> there aren't many things that I can remember that would be considered 
		positive to many. School in El salvador was a luxury that many kids did not get the chance to have, --atleast a safe and directed education that was--, this meant that my mom had to work day and night to provide
		such a luxury to me. </p>
	<br></br>
		<p>Hearing stories of how my mom got to work everyday walking miles everyday, having to wake hours earlier than most of the world, gave me perspective of what it takes to be succesful in this world and make the <em>plata</em>.
		This helped me and I hope it can help others get the motivation to do things that they thought they couldnt do. Even if that means going past what societys labels you as. Thinking that I would live in America 
		speaking english, going to a geat <b>public</b> school just is surreal to my el savadorain self. It didnt take much to make that part of my self happy, infact all it took was a joystick and a box T.V.
		But im glad that I didnt raised by some rich snob who stompts on others to <q><em>preserve</em></q> there way of life.</p>
		<br></br>
		<aside><q>Damn right I like the life I live because I went from negative to positive.</q></aside>

		<h1 class="section-title" style="padding-left: 37%;padding-right: 37%;"><span class="section-title">COMING TO AMERICA</span></h1>
			<p>For many the topic of immagration is a sensitive topic, but what many don't seem to remeber is that America was built by men and women who immagrated here and made this country what it is today. 
			Espically with groups like ISIS many  countries like America and britian (following Brexit) feel the necestiy to close there borders or tighten there immagration policy and investigate the "ones that are here".
			This approach is unhealty and only helps groups like ISIS that runs on the idea that Americans want to destroy the middleast and vice versa.</p>
