		<h1 class="header-text">I grew up during the 2000's</h1>
		<p class="header-text">For me the internet was much more than a chat room gimick that it was for many 90's kids. It was the start of the truely popular internet. With the early 2000's being known as the (.com) age for brand name company being in there infancy including ["Google","Yahoo"","Opentable","Amazon",""]</p>
		
		
		<p class="header-text">While the 90's was the very begining of the popular internet, there was clear limitations to what could be accomplished back then.</p>
